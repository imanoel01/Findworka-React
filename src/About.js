       Quite frequently you might want to use a component, 
       but change it slightly for a single case. Now, you could pass
        in an interpolated function and change them based on some props, but
         that's quite a lot of effort for overriding the styles once.

To easily make a new component that inherits the styling of another,
 just wrap it in the styled() constructor. Here we use the button from the last
  section and create a special one, extending it with some color-related styling:

    </div>
